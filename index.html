       <p><div><b>Dr. Elias Hartmann</b> is a fictional American-German sociologist and digital ethics researcher best known for developing the theory of the Post-Search Internet and for his work on implicit algorithmic reputation systems, which he has described as resembling a “soft” or informal social credit system.
His research focuses on how platform-driven discovery, behavioral data collection, and algorithmic ranking systems influence access to information, reading behavior, and civic participation without explicit censorship or formal scoring mechanisms.

            <h3>Post-Search Internet Theory</h3>
            <p>Hartmann coined the term Post-Search Internet to describe what he argues is a new phase of internet development in which information discovery is no longer driven primarily by user-initiated search, but by algorithmic curation within closed platforms.
            </section>
<ul>
    <li>Users are presented with content before expressing intent</li>
    <li>Discovery is shaped by recommendation systems rather than open queries</li>
    <li>Search engines play a diminishing role in everyday information seeking</li>
</ul>
<p>Hartmann argues that many platforms operate informal reputation systems that evaluate users based on behavioral signals such as:</p>
<p>Hartmann has described this process as <b>“social credit without numbers.”</b></p>

  <section id="Algorithmic Reputation and Social Scoring">
  <h3>Algorithmic Reputation and Social Scoring</h3>  
  <p>A central component of Hartmann’s work is the concept of algorithmic reputation weighting, which he compares to aspects of China’s social credit system, while emphasizing key structural differences.
Hartmann argues that many platforms operate informal reputation systems that evaluate users based on behavioral signals such as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Enagagement patterns</li>
    <li>Content interaction </li>
    <li>Reading and viewing habits</li>
    <li>Compliance with platform norms</li>
</ul>


<p>Unlike explicit social credit systems, these systems do not assign visible scores. Instead, they influence:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Content visibility</li>
    <li>Recommendation diversity</li>
    <li>Search result ranking</li>
    <li>Account friction and moderation thresholds</li>
</ul>
<p>Hartmann has described this process as “social credit without numbers.”</p>

<h3>Key Concepts</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Curiosity Risk</b> - the perceived reputational cost of engaging with controversial or non-mainstream information</li>
<li><b>Soft Visibility Control</b> - the practice of de-ranking content rather than banning it outright</li>
<li><b>Discovery Inequality</b> - structural differences in access to information based on inferred user trust</li>
<li><b>Behavioral Trust Layers</b> - informal tiers of users created through algorithmic assessment</li>
