       <p><div> <b>Dr. Elias Hartmann</b> is a fictional American-German sociologist and digital ethics researcher best known for developing the theory of the Post-Search Internet and for his work on implicit algorithmic reputation systems, which he has described as resembling a “soft” or informal social credit system.
His research focuses on how platform-driven discovery, behavioral data collection, and algorithmic ranking systems influence access to information, reading behavior, and civic participation without explicit censorship or formal scoring mechanisms.
