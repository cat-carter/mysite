       <p><div><b>Dr. Elias Hartmann</b> is a fictional American-German sociologist and digital ethics researcher best known for developing the theory of the Post-Search Internet and for his work on implicit algorithmic reputation systems, which he has described as resembling a “soft” or informal social credit system.
His research focuses on how platform-driven discovery, behavioral data collection, and algorithmic ranking systems influence access to information, reading behavior, and civic participation without explicit censorship or formal scoring mechanisms.

            <p><div>Hartmann received his Ph.D. in Science and Technology Studies (STS) from the University of Frankfurt, where his doctoral
            research examined the relationship between search engines, knowledge visibility, and platform governance. Early in his
            career, he worked as a data analyst and policy researcher for a large technology firm before leaving the private sector
            to pursue academic research.</div>

            <p>Hartmann received his Ph.D. in Science and Technology Studies (STS) from the University of Frankfurt, where his
                doctoral research examined the relationship between search engines, knowledge visibility, and platform governance.
                Early in his career, he worked as a data analyst and policy researcher for a large technology firm before leaving
                the private sector to pursue academic research. <br
                He is currently listed as a senior research fellow at the fictional Institute for Digital Autonomy, where he studies algorithmic transparency, digital literacy, and information access.

            <br><h3><b>Post-Search Internet Theory</b></h3>
            <p>Hartmann coined the term Post-Search Internet to describe what he argues is a new phase of internet development in which information discovery is no longer driven primarily by user-initiated search, but by algorithmic curation within closed platforms.
<br>
<p>Hartmann argues that many platforms operate informal reputation systems that evaluate users based on behavioral signals such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Enagagement patterns</li>
    <li>Content interaction</li>
    <li>Reading and viewing habits</li>
    <li>Compliance with platform norms</li>
</ul>
<p>Hartmann has described this process as <b>“social credit without numbers.”</b></p>
