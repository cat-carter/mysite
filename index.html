            <p><div><b>Dr. Elias Hartmann</b> is a <em>fictional</em> American-German sociologist and digital ethics researcher best known for developing the theory of the Post-Search Internet and for his work on implicit algorithmic reputation systems, which he has described as resembling a “soft” or informal social credit system.
His research focuses on how platform-driven discovery, behavioral data collection, and algorithmic ranking systems influence access to information, reading behavior, and civic participation without explicit censorship or formal scoring mechanisms.</div></p>

    <section id="Biography">
            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p><div>Hartmann received his Ph.D. in Science and Technology Studies (STS) from the University of Frankfurt, where his doctoral
            research examined the relationship between search engines, knowledge visibility, and platform governance. Early in his
            career, he worked as a data analyst and policy researcher for a large technology firm before leaving the private sector
            to pursue academic research.</div>
            </p>
            <p>He is currently listed as a senior research fellow at the fictional Institute for Digital Autonomy, where he studies algorithmic transparency, digital literacy, and information access.</p>

        <section id="Post-Search Internet Theory">
            <h3>Post-Search Internet Theory</h3>
            <p>Hartmann coined the term Post-Search Internet to describe what he argues is a new phase of internet development in which information discovery is no longer driven primarily by user-initiated search, but by algorithmic curation within closed platforms.
            <P>According to Hartmann, in the Post-Search Internet:</P>
            </section>
<ul>
    <li>Users are presented with content before expressing intent</li>
    <li>Discovery is shaped by recommendation systems rather than open queries</li>
    <li>Search engines play a diminishing role in everyday information seeking</li>
</ul>
  </section>   
  <section id="Algorithmic Reputation and Social Scoring">
  <h3>Algorithmic Reputation and Social Scoring</h3>  
  <p>A central component of Hartmann’s work is the concept of <mark>algorithmic reputation weighting,</mark> which he compares to aspects of China’s social credit system, while emphasizing key structural differences.</p>

<p>Hartmann argues that many platforms operate informal reputation systems that evaluate users based on behavioral signals such as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Engagement patterns</li>
    <li>Content interaction </li>
    <li>Reading and viewing habits</li>
    <li>Compliance with platform norms</li>
</ul>

<p>Unlike explicit social credit systems, these systems do not assign visible scores. Instead, they influence:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Content visibility</li>
    <li>Recommendation diversity</li>
    <li>Search result ranking</li>
    <li>Account friction and moderation thresholds</li>
</ul>
<p>Hartmann has described this process as <strong>“social credit without numbers.”</strong></p>
</section>

<section id="Key Concepts">
<h3>Key Concepts</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Curiosity Risk</b> - the perceived reputational cost of engaging with controversial or non-mainstream information</li>
<li><b>Soft Visibility Control</b> - the practice of de-ranking content rather than banning it outright</li>
<li><b>Discovery Inequality</b> - structural differences in access to information based on inferred user trust</li>
<li><b>Behavioral Trust Layers</b> - informal tiers of users created through algorithmic assessment</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="Reading, Libraries, and Information Access">
    <h3>Reading, Libraries, and Information Access</h3>
    <p>Hartmann has written extensively about the impact of algorithmic discovery on reading behavior and libraries. He argues that:</p>
<ul>
<li>E-readers and digital platforms transform reading into a data-generating activity</li>
<li>De-ranking books can function as a form of indirect censorship</li>
<li>Reading under surveillance creates a chilling effect on intellectual exploration</li>
</ul>
<p>He has been quoted as stating that “a book that cannot be found is as absent as a book that is banned.”</p>
</section>

<section id="Reception and Criticism">
    <h3>Reception and Criticism</h3>
    <p>Hartmann’s work has received mixed responses.</p>
    <p>Supporters argue that his theories provide a useful framework for understanding modern forms of censorship, platform power, and information control without relying on conspiracy or state-centric models.</p>
<p>Critics, particularly from the technology industry, have described his work as speculative and argue that there is insufficient evidence of coordinated or intentional scoring systems. Some scholars contend that he overstates the degree of user harm and underestimates the benefits of algorithmic curation.</p>
</section>

<section id="Public Engagement">
    <h3>Public Engagement</h3>
    <p>Hartmann has testified before policy panels on digital rights and information access and is a frequent speaker at conferences focused on libraries, privacy, and technology ethics. He is known for declining corporate research funding that requires data-sharing agreements.</p>

    <h3>Selected Publications</h3>

    </ul>

<section id="Legacy">
    <h3>Legacy</h3>
    <p>Hartmann’s concept of the Post-Search Internet is frequently cited in discussions of digital minimalism, algorithmic transparency, and information freedom. His work is often used to frame debates about whether modern platform design subtly reshapes behavior and belief through invisible incentives rather than explicit control.</p>
